			At the outset, web designing emerged as an easier and simple way of <strong>exchanging information</strong>. It was a better means of communication and had better networking benefits compared to the commercial reasons. Later on, the Web became an avenue for making profits, and the information space that was prior for providing free exchange thus changed to a space for commercial transactions.
		</p>
		<p>
			The open source movement first emerged when major players met and decided to begin the <em>initiative of licensing to protect software developers</em>. The movement was therefore a licensing measure meant to make source codes available to others beside the author through leasing.
		</p>
		<p>There was also need to allow programmers to distribute their software freely and enable people to modify source codes. The current web-based software developers such as <a href="http://google.com" target="_blank">PHP, Firefox, WordPress and Linux</a> are thus major contributors to development of modern websites. Open source has consequently had a direct influence on web development and browsing such as flexibility and innovative development initiatives in addition to providing network solutions.
